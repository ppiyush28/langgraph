# 🌐 langgraph

🚀 **langgraph** is a Python library for creating and managing **state-based workflows** using **state graphs**. It simplifies the process of defining, executing, and visualizing workflows for various use cases.

## ✨ Key Features
- 🧩 **State Graphs**: Build workflows as modular state graphs.
- 📊 **Visualization**: Render workflows as diagrams using Mermaid.js.
- ⚡ **Execution**: Seamlessly execute workflows with defined states and transitions.
- 🔄 **Custom Use Cases**: Examples include:
  - 🏏 Cricket statistics analysis.
  - 📐 Solving quadratic equations.
  - 🤖 Generating and improving jokes.
  - ⚖️ Calculating BMI.

## 📚 Example Use Cases
- **Cricket Analysis**: Calculate metrics like boundaries per ball.
- **Math Workflows**: Solve quadratic equations step-by-step.
- **Creative Tasks**: Generate and refine jokes dynamically.
